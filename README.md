# WEATHER APP

I created a weather app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I used the Fetch API feature of javascript to fetch the weather data of different cities from an API. The Fetch API provides an interface for fetching resources (including across the network). It will seem familiar to anyone who has used XMLHttpRequest , but the new API provides a more powerful and flexible feature set.
